# MEARN Stack Journey 🚀

This repository documents my **MEARN Stack learning journey**, which I started from **absolute zero**.

Even in the AI era, I intentionally began with **HTML & CSS** to build a **strong foundation** before moving toward advanced frontend and backend technologies.

---

## What I’ve Completed So Far ✅

### HTML
- Clean page structure
- Proper semantic tags
- Correct `div` nesting
- Forms, tables, lists, and media elements
- Readable and maintainable markup

### CSS
- Core CSS concepts
- Layout building using Flexbox & Grid
- Responsive design principles
- Background image handling (`cover`, positioning)
- Animations and hover effects
- Card-based and box layouts

### CSS Framework
- Bootstrap grid system
- Pre-built components (navbar, cards, buttons, etc.)
- Utility classes for spacing and responsiveness
- Mobile-first design approach

### JavaScript (Completed – January Target Achieved 🎯)
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Functions and logic building
- Basic form validation
- Interactive UI behavior

Completing JavaScript helped me break out of a learning loop and significantly improved my frontend confidence.

## Projects 🛠️

- **Spotify Clone**  
  Most challenging project so far.  
  Took ~6 hours and greatly improved my layout skills, CSS confidence, and overall problem-solving ability.

## Learning Style 📌

- Daily commits (consistency > motivation)
- Commit messages mostly in **Hindi** — simple and sometimes funny 😄
- I try **not to use AI tools for coding**, focusing on learning by doing  
  *(README is the only exception)*

---

## Current Status 🔥

- **Frontend:** Completed ✅  
- **JavaScript:** Completed (January target achieved) ✅  

---

## Next Goal 🎯

- **Complete Backend development by the end of February**
- Start working with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and React
- Build real-world full-stack projects

## Special Credit 🙌

> If this guy had not challenged me, I might have stayed stuck in the same loop, and I probably would not have been able to complete JavaScript. Because of him, I took a target to finish JavaScript (course) in January.
