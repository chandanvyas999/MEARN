# MEARN Stack Journey

This repository documents my **MEARN Stack learning journey**, starting from **absolute zero**.

I intentionally began with **HTML & CSS**, even in the AI era, because I wanted a **strong foundation** before moving forward.

---

## What I’ve Learned So Far

- **HTML**
  - Page structure
  - Proper `div` nesting

- **CSS**
  - Core CSS concepts
  - Layout building
  - Background image handling (`cover`, positioning)
  - Animations using motion-related properties
  - Card design and box-based layouts

- **CSS Framework**
  - Bootstrap basics

- **Project**
  - Spotify Clone  
    (Most challenging so far — took ~6 hours and improved my layout & CSS confidence a lot)

---

## Learning Style

- Daily commits (consistency matters)
- Commit messages are mostly in **Hindi** — easy to read and sometimes funny 😄
- I try **not to use AI tools for coding**, focusing on learning by doing  
  *(README is the only exception)*

## Current Goal

- Finish **JavaScript** before the end of January
- Continue completing the **MEARN stack** step by step
